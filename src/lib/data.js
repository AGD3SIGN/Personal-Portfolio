    about: "At Safe Space Therapy, the goal is to make mental wellness approachable, private, and consistent. The platform combines compassionate care with modern technology, allowing individuals to book sessions, track emotional patterns, and access guided resources in one secure space. Clients can schedule appointments, journal their thoughts, monitor mood trends, and set personal goals — all within a calm, distraction-free interface designed to reduce friction and encourage routine. The experience emphasizes clarity, trust, and emotional safety from the first interaction.",
    clients: "The platform was designed for people who want support but struggle with traditional barriers — time, stigma, uncertainty, or accessibility. Many users were balancing demanding work schedules, caregiving responsibilities, or anxiety around in-person visits. They needed a simple, reassuring environment where they could check in regularly, communicate comfortably, and see progress over time. The product focuses on consistency rather than intensity, helping users build sustainable habits instead of relying on one-time interventions.",
    challenge: "Mental health platforms often overwhelm users with complex dashboards or clinical language. The challenge was to design an experience that felt calm rather than medical — structured without feeling rigid, supportive without feeling intrusive. Key design problems included: Reducing cognitive load during emotional moments, Making scheduling effortless, Encouraging continued engagement without pressure. The interface was intentionally simplified to guide users step-by-step, prioritizing emotional comfort over feature density.",
